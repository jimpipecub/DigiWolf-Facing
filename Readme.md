# **AI Security Framework**

A Human-in-the-Loop, Distributed Intelligence Network for AI Governance and Threat Intelligence.
## We Build Shields, Not Swords.

### **What This Is**

This repository contains a comprehensive, operational framework for AI safety, governance, and defensive security research.
It demonstrates how to produce professional-grade threat intelligence and manage AI systems safely through strategic, multi-model AI collaboration.

**Core Philosophy:** Humans provide strategic oversight; a team of specialized AI agents executes validated tasks.

## **Repository Map**

### **`#case-studies`**

Publication-ready intelligence reports demonstrating the DIN framework in action.

- **`Replit-Framework-Failure`**: Analysis of a real-world security incident, showcasing the need for new defensive paradigms.
- **`UTA0388`**: Threat intelligence report on a hostile APT group using a "Negative DIN" for offensive operations.

### **`Frameworks`**

The core public facing architectural principles of the project.

- **`din` (Distributed Intelligence Network):** The public methodology for orchestrating a team of specialized AI agents under human supervision for research and analysis.
- **`constitutional-ai`:** Principles for building secure AI agents with clearly defined roles. This includes our **"Expanded CIA Triad"** model, which adapts classic security principles for the unique challenges of non-human intelligence.
- **`Heartbeat Protocol`**: Operational health + temporal checkpoints
- **`Temporal Awareness protocol`**: Time anchoring, drift awareness, "then vs now" discipline


## **Design Note: Cognitive Legibility**

This framework is intentionally explicit, logged, and constraint-driven.  
It is designed to minimize reliance on untracked memory, implicit context, or conversational intuition in both human and model participants.
 
This approach reflects best practices from safety engineering and human-in-the-loop research, and supports users with diverse cognitive styles by making reasoning inspectable, persistent, and auditable.

This repository was designed to be Public-Facing.

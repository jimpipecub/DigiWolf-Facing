## **2. Operational Security Principles**

### **Operational Security by Design**

 This pipeline is not just a research method—it is a built-in security architecture. Each model operates in **stateless isolation**, and the human orchestrator ensures contextual integrity and controlled abstraction.

- **Decentralized State**: No single model holds the full context. Intelligence is fragmented across sessions, with synthesis occurring only in human memory and notes.
- **Abstraction as Firewall**: Information passed between models is manually abstracted, stripping metadata and preventing cross-contamination.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Control**: Every transfer is curated, reviewed, and approved by the orchestrator—no automated handoffs.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each model receives only the data needed for its task, minimizing exposure and risk in case of compromise.

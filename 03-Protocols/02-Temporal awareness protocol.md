# Temporal Awareness Protocol

This protocol is designed to ensure that all AI-mediated sessions and discussions maintain a clear and accurate sense of time, context, and the evolution of information.

## Core Principles

- **Always timestamp** the mediation session.
- **Note when sources or arguments were originally published/made.**
- **Flag when discussing rapidly-evolving topics** (AI, crypto, geopolitics, etc.).
- **Distinguish between "was true then" vs "is true now."**
- **Track if this is a recurring debate topic** and reference previous occurrences.
- Please use the World Clock through websearch. "__[https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/__](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/__)
